Back to when I made my mind to become a data scientist, I knew little about data industry, and literally nothing about machine learning and SQL. What I did have were quantitative background, problem-solving skills, and most important of all, a huge passion and curiosity for data science. I still remember how excited I was the first time I read the article 'Preparing for Insight' from Insight Data Science. I made the plan and carried on step by step and now I'm much more well equipped. There are still a lot to know and to do, but I am full of passion and curiosity. Unknown is the only known thing on this road, which I will constantly face and conquer. Here is a growing list about things I plan to do. Those have been finished are marked in red.
