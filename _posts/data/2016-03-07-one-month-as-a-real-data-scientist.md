Have been working as a data scientist for more than one month. Still a lot to learn and to play with. Definitely love what I am doing and look forward to making some impacts. The data I am working with is a lot messier than datasets I've been working with before. But yeah, welcome to the real world!   
Working environment is somehow different from PhD life. You don't have that much time to understand something thoroughly and make something 'perfectly'. Get something done is much more important than get it done perfectly. Some rules I learned at Insight are still applicable here:  
**ROI**: Prioritize your tasks. Work on things with higher ROI.  
**80% rule**: Get 80% job done in a short period is much better than getting 99% done in a long time  
**15 mins rule**: No need to reinvent the wheel. Whenever you get stuck for some time (maybe 15 mins), stand up and ask around. Data sciense is teamwork.   
Skillwise, I belive these skills will be heavily involved and honed in my current project:  
1. Communication  
Definitely the most important skill. Should be able to convey your ideas and deliver your results to others fully and clearly. Be mindful about high-level thinking and talking (speak English, not math). Also, listen really well to others' ideas. Be open-minded. Listen to understand, not to be right.  
2. Information integration  
A lot of times, I will be working with multiple data/infomation from different data sources. Being able to connect the dots and integrate information is crucial.  
3. SQL  
Retrieving data from our database.   
4. Python  
Especially packages like Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, matplotlib. Data cleaning, merging, wrangling, and machine learning!  
5. R  
Though I am a big Python fan, it's good to know something new.   
6. Machine Learning  
Black box! Secret weapon!  
7. Tableau (data delivery / visualization)  
Deliver your insights and results in a neat and actionable manner.  
Some skills I want to learn but are not emphasized here include big data platform (Spark especially), interactive data visualization (D3), and database knowledge. So, here are three online courses that can get my feet wet. Play with them in my free time!  
1. [Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-big-data-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs100-1x)  
2. [Data Visualization and D3.js](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507)  
3. [Introduction to Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about)
